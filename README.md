# Travel with Trish

## Setup

The details and setup of this project are outline in [this project spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

## Overview:

Travel with Trish is a site that allows users to sign in to view and book trips. Users can see past trips, current trips, future trips, and pending trips. To book a trip a user selects a future date, duration of the trip, how many travelers and a destination from the drop down. This shows an estimated cost and allows the user to book.  The trip would then go into their pending trips.

- Ensure app follows best practices for accessibility

## Tech used:
- JavaScript
- Mocha
- Chai
- CSS
